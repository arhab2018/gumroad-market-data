## Key Findings

- **Top 1% of products capture 77.3% of total revenue** ($159.3M out of $206M)
- **Pay-What-You-Want products outsell fixed-price by 8%** (287 vs 265 avg sales)
- **$30-$50 is the pricing sweet spot** (highest sales volume at a solid price point)
- **Software Development alone = $65.8M** (32% of all tracked revenue)
- **Products with 4.5-4.9 star ratings average 1,197 sales** vs 18 for unrated products
- **Sellers with 11+ products average 5,201 total sales** vs 269 for single-product sellers
- **Bottom 50% of products share only 0.3% of revenue** ($680K)

## Methodology

This dataset was built by analyzing publicly available data on Gumroad product pages:

- **Coverage**: Products with 5+ ratings across all 18 Gumroad categories
- **Revenue estimation**: `estimated_revenue = avg_price x total_sales` (sales inferred from public rating counts and review rates)
- **Data collection**: Automated scraping of public Gumroad listings
- **Limitations**: Revenue figures are estimates, not official Gumroad data. Actual revenue may differ due to refunds, discounts, and currency conversions
- **Update frequency**: Monthly

## Use Cases

- **Validate a product idea** before building — check category demand and pricing benchmarks
- **Find underserved niches** with high demand density and low competition
- **Benchmark your product** against category averages for pricing, sales, and ratings
- **Academic research** on creator economy markets and digital product economics
- **Build tools** for digital product creators using real market data

## Quick Start

### Python

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/categories.csv")
print(df.sort_values("estimated_revenue_usd", ascending=False).head(5))
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const categories = require("./data/json/categories.json");
const top5 = categories
  .sort((a, b) => b.estimated_revenue_usd - a.estimated_revenue_usd)
  .slice(0, 5);
console.table(top5);
```

### R

```r
df <- read.csv("data/categories.csv")
head(df[order(-df$estimated_revenue_usd), ], 5)
```
